# Contributing to ember-container-query

Open source projects like `ember-container-query` live on your words of encouragement and contribution. Please give feedback, report issues, or submit pull requests!

Here are some guidelines to help you and everyone else.


## Local development

You can get started in 2 steps:

1. Run `pnpm install` to install project dependencies. This will build the addon `ember-container-query`.
1. Run `pnpm start` to start `docs-app` ([http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)) and `test-app` ([http://localhost:4300/tests](http://localhost:4300/tests?hidepassed)).

<summary>Lint files</summary>

1. When you write code, please check that it meets the linting rules.

    ```sh
    # From the workspace root
    pnpm lint
    ```

1. You can run `lint:fix` to automatically fix linting errors.

    ```sh
    # From the workspace root
    pnpm lint:fix
    ```

</details>


<details>

<summary>Run tests</summary>

1. When you write code, please check that all tests continue to pass.

    ```sh
    # From the workspace root
    pnpm test
    ```

</details>


<details>

<summary>Publish packages (for admins)</summary>

1. Generate a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/) in GitHub, with default values for scopes (none selected).

1. Run the `release:changelog` script. This removes changesets, updates the package versions, and updates the `CHANGELOG`'s.

    ```sh
    # From the workspace root
    GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> pnpm release:changelog
    ```

    The `release:changelog` script also updated the workspace root's version (by following the highest version formula). We will use it to name the tag that will be published.

    ```
    # Highest version formula
    workspace root version = max(
      max(all package versions),
      workspace root version + 0.0.1,
    );
    ```

1. [Create a tag](https://github.com/ijlee2/ember-container-query/releases/new) and provide release notes. The tag name should match the package version.

1. Publish the package.

    ```sh
    # From the workspace root
    pnpm release:publish
    ```

## How can I help?

If you haven't before, I encourage you to watch [Sean Massa's mini-talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcSKlsc_AhQ) on what it means to be a contributor. To sum up the talk, you can be a contributor in many ways. I want you to discover a path that meets your goals well!

Here are some suggestions to help you start:
