      <strong>Buffonâ€™s needle</strong>
      is a classic Monte Carlo simulation that we can conduct in
      a classroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      We give the students, say 10 needles each, and have them
      drop the needles on a paper that we provide also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper is special, in that it has parallel lines that
      are separated by the length of a needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each student records how many needles intersect one of the
      lines, then we tally their numbers to arrive at a very
      special number. (Guess
